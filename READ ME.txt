Sorting Visualizer

This project is a Sorting Visualizer application built using C++ and wxWidgets. It allows users to visualize the step-by-step execution of various sorting algorithms in a dynamic and interactive interface. The application is designed to help users understand how sorting algorithms work by visualizing comparisons, swaps, and placements in real-time.

Features

Algorithms Supported:

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Selection Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort



Dynamic Bar Visualization:


Each bar represents an element in the array being sorted.

Highlights comparisons and swaps in real-time.


Interactive Controls:


Add custom bars (values between 1-100).

Adjust sorting speed dynamically using a slider.

Refresh the array with random values.


Responsive Design:


Automatically adjusts visualization based on window size.


How It Works:


Bar Representation: Each bar corresponds to a value in the array.

Real-Time Updates: Sorting steps are displayed in real-time, with bars being compared or swapped highlighted in different colors.

Interactive Input: Users can add new bars or refresh the array with random unique values.

Speed Control: Adjust the speed of visualization to observe sorting at your own pace.

Installation and Usage

Prerequisites:

wxWidgets Library: Ensure you have wxWidgets installed on your system.
